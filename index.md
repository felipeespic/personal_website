| Welcome to my website. I am an audio/speech technology developer and researcher. Currently, I am doing my PhD at the [CSTR-University of Edinburgh](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/), where I research on new signal representations and acoustic modelling for statistical parametric speech synthesis. Also, my interests cover a wide range of disciplines, such as Music, Digital Audio, real-time audio effects, Computer Programming, Acoustics, and so on. You will find on this website information about me, including education, publications, projects, trips, and especially the stuff that I love the most: Audio Technology Development !! | <img src="img/profile_pic3_small5.png" alt="profile" width="800"/>|
